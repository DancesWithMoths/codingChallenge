Running instructions:

1. Clone the repo into a local file. All required files and csvs should already be present.
2. Run the program via command line, using "python brokerChallenge.py". Text will flash up presenting one of three options. Typing in 1, 2 or 3 and pressing enter will execute that option (further inputs may be required).
3. The first option will take in the two broker files and create two normalized csv files, as well as one combinedDataSet file containing aggregated data from both brokers. The other options are for data reporting and searching via broker - they require a normalized
   data set to run. It is recommended to run the first option to generate the aggregated, normalized data set and then passing it in as 'combinedDataSet.csv' to test the other options.
